# IEEE_SP22
This contains our code for our IEEE Spring 2022 Quarterly Project. The project is a water sensor, to be attached to a shower pipe, that keeps track of the water that flows through it and notifies the user via an LED (WIP: to be changed to a phone notification) when they exceed a certain amount of water. The required resources to build this project are:
- Arduino UNO
- [A water sensor such as this one](https://www.amazon.com/DIGITEN-Sensor-Switch-Flowmeter-Counter/dp/B00VKATCRQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CMKTZATOVN8L&keywords=g1%2F2+water+sensor&qid=1652067755&sprefix=g1%2F2+water+sensor%2Caps%2C125&sr=8-1)
- Wires to hook everything up, obviously
Have fun! (It's just one small file, so it shouldn't be too demanding to understand.)
